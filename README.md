# Salvage logging and subsequent post-windthrow management lead to impoverished forest bird communities for two decades
R code for the publication "Salvage logging and subsequent post-windthrow management lead to impoverished forest bird communities for two decades"


All graphics created with the code were later modified using CorelDRAW (and tables were modified using excel) - therefore do not expect exact same graphics in code output and the publication.


Feel free to use and copy the code in whatever way you wish! 

In case you have any questions about it, please write mwalesiak@ibs.bialowieza.pl
